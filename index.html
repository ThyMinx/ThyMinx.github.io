								<h3>Networking Course Work</h3>
								<p>For my networking module we were tasked to create a client and server that could handle different types of protocols: whois, http0.9, http1.0, http1.1. The client would send the appropriate request format depending on the protocol as well as a GET or PUT/POST. The server would then handle the request accordingly and respond using the correct format and protocol.<br/>This was all done using <strong>C#</strong>.</p>

								<h3>Morph Surfing</h3>
								<p>In my own time I decided to try and use the <strong>Unity Engine</strong> to create a game like subway surfers. As I'm not the best at 3D modelling I decided to use a basic shape with the ability to "morph" it's shape to give it "life". The game was mainly an experiment to try different things such as connecting with the google play services to allow for online leaderboards.<br/>This was done using <strong>C#</strong> in the <strong>Unity Engine</strong>.</p>

								<h3>Software Systems</h3>
								<p>During my time at Intradev Ltd. I worked on a few projects, all of which were software systems. These were all created in ASP .NET using MVC as the architecture. There isn't much I can discuss about the systems other than I worked on a few, some I joined midway through and others I worked from the ground up on them.<br/>These systems were made using <strong>C#, HTML, CSS and SCSS, JavaScript and jQuery</strong>.</p>
